# Air Ticket Sales System

This repository contains the full source code of my group's solution to the 2nd year group project at City, University of London.

We have been asked to build from the bottom a fully functional system that will keep records of ticket sold by a travel agency to customers, and produce reports required by an airline. All parts of the system are based on exact specification and requirements provided to the students by the University.

### Our solution

We have chosen to create the system as a web app, based purely on React for the user interface, and Node & Express server-side, with MongoDB as our chosen database.

### Intallation

In order to run the front on of the website, clone this repository, and run `yarn start` inside it. This will run the app in development mode, available at http://localhost:3000.
